Setup terraform:
configure terraform: https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/guides/provider_reference
create service account: https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/access/create-enable-service-accounts-for-instances
get the key of the service account
set the key to env:  $Env:Path += ";c:\temp"
Running Terraform outside of Google Cloud
If you are running terraform outside of Google Cloud, generate a service account key and set the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS environment variable to the path of the service account key. Terraform will use that key for authentication.

Disabling mtls authentication
mtls authentication will soon become enabled by default if your system supports it. To disable mtls authentication at any point set GOOGLE_API_USE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE to false.
